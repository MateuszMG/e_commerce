Awesome—here’s a practical, dependency-aware task list to build your e-commerce on NestJS + Next.js (TypeScript) with the exact tech you chose.

Phase 0 — Foundations & Planning

Define business scope: MVP features, roles (guest, user, admin), SLAs/SLOs (≥5k rpm, p95 latency).

Create monorepo (e.g., pnpm workspaces / Nx / Turborepo).

Decide service boundaries: users, products, catalog/search, orders, payments, cart, checkout, notifications.

Pick schema conventions & coding standards (ESLint, Prettier, commit lint, conventional commits).

Secrets strategy: Azure Key Vault; define secrets map per service.

Phase 1 — Cloud & DevOps Setup (Azure)

Create Azure subscription + resource groups (dev/stage/prod).

Provision:

AKS (Kubernetes), Azure Container Registry (ACR).

Azure Database for PostgreSQL (Flex Server) for transactions.

Azure Cosmos DB (Mongo API) for catalog (NoSQL).

Azure Cache for Redis for sessions.

Azure VM / Managed offering for RabbitMQ (or self-hosted on AKS statefulset).

Elasticsearch + Kibana + Logstash (Elastic on Azure Marketplace or self-hosted on AKS).

Azure Files/Blob Storage for media (product images).

Azure Application Gateway + Nginx Ingress Controller (L7 LB).

Networking & security:

VNet, subnets, NSGs, private endpoints for DBs.

Pod/Node security policies, network policies (Calico).

CI/CD:

GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps pipelines: build, test, scan, push to ACR, deploy to AKS via Helm.

Automatic versioning & changelogs.

Observability baseline:

Prometheus Operator on AKS.

Grafana dashboards.

ELK: ship logs with Fluent Bit → Logstash → Elasticsearch → Kibana.

Sentry DSNs/secrets and release integration.

Phase 2 — API Platform & Contracts

Scaffold NestJS gateway (API Gateway/BFF if needed) + per-service NestJS projects.

Add @nestjs/swagger; define DTOs, validation pipes, class-validator.

Generate OpenAPI specs per service; publish to a “contracts” package.

Client type generation for Next.js with openapi-typescript (or Orval/Swagger Codegen) wired into CI.

Common library: types, error model, tracing middleware (OpenTelemetry optional).

Phase 3 — Identity & Security

Set up Auth0 tenant, apps (SPA for Next.js, M2M for services).

Configure JWT validation in NestJS (AuthGuard), role/permission model (RBAC), refresh token flow if needed.

Next.js Auth0 SDK (SSR compatibility), session backed by Redis.

Rate limiting (Nest rate-limit + Redis), input sanitization, CORS, Helmet.

Secrets from Azure Key Vault mounted/injected to pods.

Phase 4 — Data Layer (Polyglot Persistence)

PostgreSQL:

Schemas for users, orders, payments, inventory, refunds.

Migrations (Prisma/TypeORM) + seed scripts.

Read replicas + PgBouncer.

Cosmos DB (Mongo API):

Collections for products, categories, attributes, inventory snapshots.

Partitioning strategy (category/brand), TTL for soft-cache docs if needed.

Data access libs in each service; repository patterns; transaction boundaries (sagas/outbox for cross-service).

Phase 5 — Core Microservices (NestJS)

Users Service

Auth0 user linkage, profiles, addresses, GDPR endpoints.

Products Service

Admin CRUD for products, categories, variants, pricing, media (uploads → Azure Blob).

Emits product events (created/updated) to RabbitMQ.

Catalog/Search Service

Elasticsearch index design: analyzers, facets, synonyms.

Ingest pipeline: product events → Logstash (optional) → ES; backfill job.

Cart Service

Cart state in Redis; persistence snapshot in Cosmos DB.

Price/stock checks on add/update.

Orders Service

Create/confirm orders, reserve inventory, handle saga with Payments.

ACID in PostgreSQL; outbox pattern for events.

Payments Service (PayPal)

PayPal SDK integration (create order, capture, webhooks).

Webhook verifier, idempotency keys, refund flows.

Inventory Service

Stock reservations, decrements, re-stocking, oversell protection.

Notifications Service

Email/webhooks (optional), future SMS; consumes order/payment events via RabbitMQ.

Phase 6 — Frontend (Next.js + TypeScript)

App structure: public catalog, PDP, cart, checkout, account, admin (if included).

Data fetching: REST clients generated from OpenAPI types.

Auth0 integration (SSR + CSR), protected routes, account pages.

SEO: SSR for product/category pages, sitemaps, Open Graph tags.

Image delivery via Next Image + Azure Blob CDN endpoint.

Observability: Sentry browser SDK, performance tracing.

Phase 7 — Search & Discovery

Autocomplete endpoint, filters/facets, sort strategies.

Synonym sets, typo tolerance, relevance tuning dashboards.

Reindex tools + blue/green index swaps.

Phase 8 — Async & Reliability

RabbitMQ setup: exchanges/queues for product, order, payment, inventory topics.

Retry & DLQ policies; idempotent consumers.

Outbox/inbox patterns for exactly-once semantics where needed.

Graceful shutdown & health endpoints (/health, /ready).

Phase 9 — Observability, Logging, Alerting

Prometheus scraping: service metrics, Node/Pod, PostgreSQL exporter, RabbitMQ exporter, Redis exporter, Elasticsearch exporter.

Grafana dashboards per service + infra.

SLOs & alerts (latency, error rate, saturation, queue lag, index health).

Structured logs (JSON) → Fluent Bit → Logstash → ES; Kibana spaces & saved searches.

Sentry server SDKs (NestJS) + release tagging from CI.

Phase 10 — Security & Compliance

OWASP ASVS/Top-10 checklist; dependency scanning (Dependabot/Snyk).

WAF rules on Application Gateway; bot/DoS protection; rate limits.

Audit logs for auth/payment/order actions.

Backup & restore runbooks (PostgreSQL, Cosmos, ES snapshots, Blob).

Data retention policies & PII minimization.

Phase 11 — Packaging & Deployment

Dockerfiles per service (multi-stage builds), health checks.

Helm charts/Kustomize; environment overlays (dev/stage/prod).

Blue/green or canary deploys via AKS; HPA/VPA settings.

Ingress (Nginx) with TLS (Let’s Encrypt/Key Vault certs).

CDN config (Azure Front Door optional) for static/media.

Phase 12 — Testing & Quality Gates

Unit tests (Jest) + integration tests (supertest) per service.

Contract tests (OpenAPI schema tests) + consumer-driven tests.

E2E flows (Playwright/Cypress) for checkout & payment.

Load & soak tests (k6) to validate ≥5,000 rpm + spike tests.

Chaos drills (pod kills, node drains), failover rehearsals.

Phase 13 — Data Migration & Admin

Admin backoffice (basic) for products, orders, refunds.

Importers for catalog (CSV/JSON) into Cosmos & ES.

Reconciliation jobs: orders ↔ payments ↔ inventory.

Phase 14 — Go-Live

Final security review, pen test, runbooks.

Warm caches, prime search index.

Observability dashboard wall + alert on-call.

Launch checklist & rollback plan.

Deliverables/Artifacts per Phase

Contracts package (OpenAPI) + generated TS client.

Helm charts for each service.

Grafana dashboards, Kibana spaces, Sentry projects.

Runbooks (on-call, incident, backup/restore, reindex).

Load test reports proving 5k rpm.

If you want, I can turn this into a Jira-ready CSV (epics → stories → tasks) or an Nx workspace layout with folds
